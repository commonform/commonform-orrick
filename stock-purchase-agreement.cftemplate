        \ Repurchase Option; Vesting  \

            \\ In the event of the voluntary or involuntary termination of <Purchaser>'s <Continuous Service Status> (as defined below) for any reason (including death or <Disability> (as defined below)), with or without cause, the <Company> shall upon the date of such termination (the ""Termination Date"") have an irrevocable, exclusive option (the ""Repurchase Option"") for a period of [Repurchase Period Months] months from such date to repurchase all or any portion of the Unvested <Shares> (as defined below) held by <Purchaser> as of the <Termination Date> at the original purchase price per Share (adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends and the like) specified in {Sale of Stock}. As used in this <Agreement>, ""Unvested Shares"" means <Shares> that have not yet been released from the <Repurchase Option>.

            \ Automatic Exercise  \ Unless the <Company> notifies <Purchaser> within [Repurchase Period Months] months from the <Termination Date> that it does not intend to exercise its <Repurchase Option> with respect to some or all of the <Unvested Shares>, the <Repurchase Option> shall be deemed automatically exercised by the <Company> as of the end of such [Repurchase Period Months]-month period following such <Termination Date>, provided that the <Company> may notify <Purchaser> that it is exercising its <Repurchase Option> as of a date prior to the end of such [Repurchase Period Months]-month period. Unless <Purchaser> is otherwise notified by the <Company> pursuant to the preceding sentence that the <Company> does not intend to exercise its <Repurchase Option> as to some or all of the <Unvested Shares> to which it applies at the time of termination, execution of this <Agreement> by <Purchaser> constitutes written notice to <Purchaser> of the <Company>'s intention to exercise its <Repurchase Option> with respect to all <Unvested Shares> to which such <Repurchase Option> applies. The <Company>, at its choice, may satisfy its payment obligation to <Purchaser> with respect to exercise of the <Repurchase Option> by either

                \ Check  \ delivering a check to <Purchaser> in the amount of the purchase price for the <Unvested Shares> being repurchased, or

                \ Cancellation of Indebtedness  \ in the event <Purchaser> is indebted to the <Company>, canceling an amount of such indebtedness equal to the purchase price for the <Unvested Shares> being repurchased, or

                \\ by a combination of {Check} and {Cancellation of Indebtedness}

            so that the combined payment and cancellation of indebtedness equals such purchase price. In the event of any deemed automatic exercise of the <Repurchase Option> pursuant to {Automatic Exercise} in which <Purchaser> is indebted to the <Company>, such indebtedness equal to the purchase price of the <Unvested Shares> being repurchased shall be deemed automatically canceled as of the end of the [Repurchase Period Months]-month period following the <Termination Date> unless the <Company> otherwise satisfies its payment obligations. As a result of any repurchase of <Unvested Shares> pursuant to {Automatic Exercise}, the <Company> shall become the legal and beneficial owner of the <Unvested Shares> being repurchased and shall have all rights and interest therein or related thereto, and the <Company> shall have the right to transfer to its own name the number of <Unvested Shares> being repurchased by the <Company>, without further action by <Purchaser>.

            \\ [Percentage of Shares Subject to Vesting] of the <Shares> shall initially be subject to the <Repurchase Option> (the ""Vesting Shares""). [Cliff Shares] of the <Vesting Shares> shall be released from the <Repurchase Option> on [Cliff Date], and an additional [Vesting Increment] of the <Vesting Shares> shall be released from the <Repurchase Option> on the [Vesting Date] day of each month thereafter (and if there is no corresponding day, the last day of the month), until all <Vesting Shares> are released from the <Repurchase Option>; provided, however, that such scheduled releases from the <Repurchase Option> shall immediately cease as of the <Termination Date>. Fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

    # ((unless Double-Trigger Acceleration begin))

            \\ Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vesting of the <Unvested Shares> shall accelerate such that the <Repurchase Option> in {Repurchase Option; Vesting} shall lapse as to [Acceleration Percentage] of the <Unvested Shares>, effective as of immediately prior to consummation of a <Change of Control>. As used in this <Agreement>, ""Change of Control"" means a sale of all or substantially all of the <Company>'s assets other than to an <Excluded Entity> (as defined below), a merger, consolidation or other capital reorganization or business combination transaction of the <Company> with or into another corporation, limited liability company or other entity other than an <Excluded Entity>, or the consummation of a transaction, or series of related transactions, in which any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the <Exchange Act>) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the <Exchange Act>), directly or indirectly, of all of the <Company>'s then outstanding voting securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction shall not constitute a <Change of Control> if its purpose is to change the jurisdiction of the <Company>'s incorporation, create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who hold the <Company>'s securities immediately before such transaction, or obtain funding for the <Company> in a financing that is approved by the <Company>'s Board of Directors. An ""Excluded Entity"" means a corporation, limited liability company or other entity of which the holders of voting capital stock of the <Company> outstanding immediately prior to such transaction are the direct or indirect holders of voting securities representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of such corporation's, limited liability company's or other entity's voting securities outstanding immediately after such transaction.

                \\ a sale of all or substantially all of the <Company>'s assets other than to an <Excluded Entity> (as defined below),

                    \\ create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons who hold the <Company>'s securities immediately before such transaction, or

                    \\ obtain funding for the <Company> in a financing that is approved by the <Company>'s Board of Directors.

                An ""Excluded Entity"" means a corporation, limited liability company or other entity of which the holders of voting capital stock of the <Company> outstanding immediately prior to such transaction are the direct or indirect holders of voting securities representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of such corporation's, limited liability company's or other entity's voting securities outstanding immediately after such transaction.  As used in this <Agreement>, ""Cause"" for the <Company> (or a successor, if appropriate) to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment shall exist under the following conditions

                    \\ <Purchaser>'s willful and continued failure to substantially perform <Purchaser>'s duties to the <Company> after there has been delivered to <Purchaser> by the <Company>'s Board of Directors a written demand for substantial performance and opportunity to cure which sets forth in detail the specific respects in which the <Company>'s Board of Directors believes that <Purchaser> has not substantially performed <Purchaser>'s duties;

                For purposes of clarity, a termination without "<Cause>" does not include any termination that occurs as a result of <Purchaser>'s death or disability.  The determination as to whether <Purchaser>'s <Continuous Service Status> has been terminated for <Cause> shall be made in good faith by the <Company> and shall be final and binding on <Purchaser>. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the <Company>'s ability to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment or consulting relationship at any time, and the term "<Company>" will be interpreted to include any <Subsidiary>, <Parent>, <Affiliate>, or any successor thereto, if appropriate.((if Acceleration on Resignation for Good Reason begin)) As used in this <Agreement>, ""Good Reason"" will mean <Purchaser>'s resignation due to the occurrence of any of the following conditions which occurs without <Purchaser>'s written consent, provided that the requirements regarding advance notice and an opportunity to cure set forth below are satisfied:

Upon receipt of such notice, the <Company> will have 30 days during which it may remedy the <Good Reason> condition and not be required to provide for the vesting acceleration described herein as a result of such proposed resignation. If the <Good Reason> condition is not remedied within such 30-day period, <Purchaser> may resign based on the <Good Reason> condition specified in the notice effective no later than 30 days following the expiration of the 30-day cure period.

        \ Right of First Refusal \

            \\ Before any <Shares> held by <Purchaser> or any transferee of <Purchaser> (either being sometimes referred to herein as the ""Holder"") may be sold or otherwise transferred (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the <Company> or its assignee(s) shall have a right of first refusal to purchase the <Shares> on the terms and conditions set forth in this {Right of First Refusal} (the ""Right of First Refusal""), which the <Company> may either

                \\ reject to exercise its <Right of First Refusal> and permit the transfer of the <Shares> to the <Proposed Transferee> (as defined below).

            \ Notice of Proposed Transfer  \ The <Holder> of the <Shares> shall deliver to the <Company> a written notice (the ""Notice"") stating:

                \\ the <Holder>'s intention to sell or otherwise transfer such <Shares>;

                \\ the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (""Proposed Transferee"");

The <Company>, in consultation with its legal counsel, may require the <Holder> to provide an opinion of counsel evidencing compliance with applicable securities laws. If the <Shares> described in the <Notice> are not transferred to the <Proposed Transferee> within such period, or if the <Holder> proposes to change the price or other terms to make them more favorable to the <Proposed Transferee>, a new <Notice> shall be given to the <Company>, and the <Company> and/or its assignees shall again be offered the <Right of First Refusal> before any <Shares> held by the <Holder> may be sold or otherwise transferred.

        \ Company's Right to Purchase upon Involuntary Transfer  \ In the event, at any time after the date of this <Agreement>, of any transfer by operation of law or other involuntary transfer (including divorce or intestate transfer upon death, but excluding transfer upon death by will (to any transferee) or a transfer to <Immediate Family> as set forth in {Exception for Certain Family Transfers}) of all or a portion of the <Shares> by the record holder thereof, the <Company> shall have the right to purchase any or all of the <Shares> transferred at the fair market value of the <Shares> on the date of transfer (as determined by the <Company> in its sole discretion). Upon such a transfer, the <Holder> shall promptly notify the Secretary of the <Company> of such transfer. The right to purchase such <Shares> shall be provided to the <Company> for a period of 30 days following receipt by the <Company> of written notice from the <Holder>.

        \ Assignment  \ The right of the <Company> to purchase any part of the <Shares> may be assigned in whole or in part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the <Company> or other persons or organizations.

        \ Restrictions Binding on Transferees  \ All transferees of <Shares> or any interest therein will receive and hold such <Shares> or interest subject to the provisions of this <Agreement>, including, insofar as applicable, the <Repurchase Option>.

        \ Termination of Rights  \ The <Right of First Refusal> granted the <Company> by {Right of First Refusal} and the right to repurchase the <Shares> in the event of an involuntary transfer granted the <Company> by {Company's Right to Purchase upon Involuntary Transfer} shall terminate upon the first sale of Common Stock of the <Company> to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") (other than a registration statement relating solely to the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee incentive or benefit plan) or  any transfer or conversion of <Shares> made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory consolidation of the <Company> with or into another corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation thereof is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"").

        \ Lock-up Agreement  \ If so requested by the <Company> or the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering of the <Company>'s securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, <Purchaser> shall not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the <Company> however or whenever acquired (except for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the <Company> or such underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus such additional period, to the extent required by FINRA rules, up to a maximum of 216 days from the effective date of the registration statement, and <Purchaser> shall execute an agreement reflecting the foregoing as may be requested by the underwriters at the time of such offering.

        \ Escrow of Unvested Shares  \ For purposes of facilitating the enforcement of the provisions of {Limitations on Transfer}, <Purchaser> agrees to deliver a Stock Power in the form attached to this <Agreement> as {Stock Power} executed by <Purchaser> and by <Purchaser>'s spouse (if required for transfer), in blank, and such stock certificate(s), if any, to the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, to hold such <Shares> (and stock certificate(s), if any) and Stock Power in escrow and to take all such actions and to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are required in accordance with the terms of this <Agreement>. <Purchaser> hereby acknowledges that the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, is so appointed as the escrow holder with the foregoing authorities as a material inducement to make this <Agreement> and that said appointment is coupled with an interest and is accordingly irrevocable. <Purchaser> agrees that said escrow holder shall not be liable to any party hereof (or to any other party). The escrow holder may rely upon any letter, notice or other document executed by any signature purported to be genuine and may resign at any time. <Purchaser> agrees that if the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, resigns as escrow holder for any or no reason, the Board of Directors of the <Company> shall have the power to appoint a successor to serve as escrow holder pursuant to the terms of this <Agreement>.

        \ Investment and Taxation Representations  \ In connection with the purchase of the <Shares>, <Purchaser> represents to the <Company> the following:

            \\ <Purchaser> is aware of the <Company>'s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient information about the <Company> to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the <Shares>. <Purchaser> is purchasing the <Shares> for investment for <Purchaser>'s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof within the meaning of the <Securities Act> or under any applicable provision of state law. <Purchaser> does not have any present intention to transfer the <Shares> to any other person or entity.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that the <Shares> have not been registered under the <Securities Act> by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of <Purchaser>'s investment intent as expressed herein.

            \\ <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the <Securities Act> or an exemption from such registration is available. <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the <Company> is under no obligation to register the securities.

            \ Rule 144  \ <Purchaser> is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the <Securities Act>, which, in substance, permits limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. <Purchaser> understands that the <Company> provides no assurances as to whether he or she will be able to resell any or all of the <Shares> pursuant to Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the <Company> be subject to the reporting requirements of the <Exchange Act>, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the <Shares> has held the <Shares> for certain specified time periods, and under certain circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only pursuant to brokered transactions. Notwithstanding {Rule 144}, <Purchaser> acknowledges and agrees to the restrictions set forth in {Burden of Proof} below.

            \ Burden of Proof  \ <Purchaser> further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the <Securities Act>, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

            \\ <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> is not subject to any of the "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the <Securities Act> (attached hereto as {Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended}).

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of <Purchaser>'s purchase or disposition of the <Shares>. <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> has consulted any tax consultants <Purchaser> deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the <Shares> and that <Purchaser> is not relying on the <Company> for any tax advice.

        \ Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders  \

            \ Legends \ Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the <Shares>, shall bear the following legends (as well as any legends required by applicable state and federal corporate and securities laws):

            \ Stop-Transfer Notices  \ <Purchaser> agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, the <Company> may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the <Company> transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.

                \\ to transfer on its books any <Shares> that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this <Agreement> or

                \\ to treat as owner of such <Shares> or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such <Shares> shall have been so transferred.

            \ Legend and Notice Removal  \ When all of the following events have occurred, the <Shares> then held by <Purchaser> will no longer be subject to the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and the <Company> will remove any stop-transfer notices associated with the transfer restrictions imposed by this <Agreement>:

                \\ the expiration or termination of the lock-up provisions of {Lock-up Agreement} (and of any agreement entered pursuant to {Lock-up Agreement}).

            After such time and upon <Purchaser>'s request, a new stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for the remaining <Shares>, shall be issued without the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and delivered to <Purchaser>.

    # ((unless Certificated Shares begin))

        \ Required Notices  \ <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Shares> are issued and shall be held subject to all the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders}, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the <Company> and any amendments thereto, copies of which are on file at the principal office of the <Company>.

        \ No Employment Rights  \ Nothing in this <Agreement> shall affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the <Company>, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the <Company>, to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment or consulting relationship, for any reason, with or without cause.

        \ Section 83(b) Election  \

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the <Shares> and the fair market value of the <Shares> as of the date any <restriction>s on the <Shares> lapse. In this context, ""restriction"" means the right of the <Company> to buy back the <Shares> pursuant to the <Repurchase Option> set forth in {Repurchase Option; Vesting}. <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may elect to be taxed at the time the <Shares> are purchased, rather than when and as the <Repurchase Option> expires, by filing an election under Section 83(b) (an ""83(b) Election"") of the <Code> with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date of purchase. Even if the fair market value of the <Shares> at the time of the execution of this <Agreement> equals the amount paid for the <Shares>, the election must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future. <Purchaser> understands that failure to file such an election in a timely manner may result in adverse tax consequences for <Purchaser>. <Purchaser> further understands that an additional copy of such election form should be filed with <Purchaser>'s federal income tax return for the calendar year in which the date of this <Agreement> falls. <Purchaser> acknowledges that the foregoing is only a summary of the effect of United States federal income taxation with respect to purchase of the <Shares> hereunder, does not purport to be complete, and is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that the <Company> has directed <Purchaser> to seek independent advice regarding the applicable provisions of the <Code>, the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which <Purchaser> may reside, and the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s death, and <Purchaser> has consulted, and has been fully advised by, <Purchaser>'s own tax advisor regarding such tax laws and tax consequences or has knowingly chosen not to consult such a tax advisor. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that neither the <Company> nor any subsidiary or representative of the <Company> has made any warranty or representation to <Purchaser> with respect to the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s purchase of the <Shares> or of the making or failure to make an <83(b) Election>.

        \!! <Purchaser> (and not the <Company>, its agents or any other person) shall be solely responsible for appropriately filing such form with the IRS, even if <Purchaser> requests the <Company>, its agents or any other person make this filing on <Purchaser>'s behalf.

        \\ <Purchaser> agrees that <Purchaser> will execute and deliver to the <Company> with this executed <Agreement> a copy of the <Acknowledgment> and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election (the ""Acknowledgment""), attached hereto as {Acknowledgment and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election} and, if <Purchaser> decides to make an <83(b) Election>, a copy of the <83(b) Election>, attached hereto as {Election Under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986}.
